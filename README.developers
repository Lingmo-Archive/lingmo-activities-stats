# Commit policy

Every non-trivial patch must go through the review before it goes into the
master branch.

        project:    KActivities

If you don't have an account for identity.kde.org, you can send smaller
patches to the lingmo-devel@kde.org mailing list, or (please don't) directly
to the repository maintainer (see MAINTAINER file).


# Code policy

The code needs to follow KDElibs coding style. You can find more information
about the style here:

    http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style

Macros in CMakeLists.txt should be lowercase throughout the project,
and indentation should be 3, with the closing parenthesis in the same level
as the content.
